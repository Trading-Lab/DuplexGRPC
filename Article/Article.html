<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>So if you have been around a while you will have undoubtedly come across the 
need to perform some sort of remote procedure call. There are many frameworks 
that allow this, WebApi, WCF, just about any REST Api you can think of, Service 
Stack etc etc</p>
<p>This is all fairly standard stuff we call a remote systems method with some 
parameters (or not) and get a response (or not)</p>
<p>Those of you that have also used things like WCF will recall that WCF also 
supported Duplex channels, where the server side code was capable of calling 
clients back on a callback channel. This is quite useful for things like 
notifications/price updates things like that.</p>
<p>Now WCF is old and kind of tied to Windows really, REST is REST no arguing 
with that. However over time it is natural for new frameworks to appear, and the 
people at Google came out with one called
<a href="https://grpc.io" target="_blank">gRPC</a> which allows you to define 
your contracts in their well known protobuf syntax, and then using 
Go/C++/Java/Python/C# to build working services against the proto files.</p>
<p>While there is a whole slew of excellent tutorials on gRPC , there are not 
many on Duplex comms. This article will try and demonstrate duplex gRPC , and 
also explain some core gRPC concepts along the way</p>
<h2>Where is the code?</h2>

<h2>What is GPC</h2>
<p>This section is borrowed from the introductory guide
<a href="https://grpc.io/docs/what-is-grpc/introduction/" target="_blank">
https://grpc.io/docs/what-is-grpc/introduction/</a></p>
<p>In gRPC, a client application can directly call a method on a server 
application on a different machine as if it were a local object, making it 
easier for you to create distributed applications and services. As in many RPC 
systems, gRPC is based around the idea of defining a service, specifying the 
methods that can be called remotely with their parameters and return types. On 
the server side, the server implements this interface and runs a gRPC server to 
handle client calls. On the client side, the client has a stub (referred to as 
just a client in some languages) that provides the same methods as the server.</p>
<p><img alt="" height="327" src="grpcOverview.png" width="552"></p>
<p>gRPC clients and servers can run and talk to each other in a variety of 
environments - from servers inside Google to your own desktop - and can be 
written in any of gRPC’s supported languages. So, for example, you can easily 
create a gRPC server in Java with clients in Go, Python, or Ruby. In addition, 
the latest Google APIs will have gRPC versions of their interfaces, letting you 
easily build Google functionality into your applications.</p>
<p><strong>Working with Protocol Buffers</strong></p>
<p>By default, gRPC uses Protocol Buffers, Google’s mature open source mechanism 
for serializing structured data (although it can be used with other data formats 
such as JSON). Here’s a quick intro to how it works. If you’re already familiar 
with protocol buffers, feel free to skip ahead to the next section.<br><br>The 
first step when working with protocol buffers is to define the structure for the 
data you want to serialize in a proto file: this is an ordinary text file with a 
.proto extension. Protocol buffer data is structured as messages, where each 
message is a small logical record of information containing a series of 
name-value pairs called fields. Here’s a simple example:</p>
<pre lang="jscript">
message Person {
  string name = 1;
  int32 id = 2;
  bool has_ponycopter = 3;
}
</pre>
<p>Then, once you’ve specified your data structures, you use the protocol buffer compiler protoc to generate data access classes in your preferred language(s) from your proto definition. These provide simple accessors for each field, like name() and set_name(), as well as methods to serialize/parse the whole structure to/from raw bytes. So, for instance, if your chosen language is C++, running the compiler on the example above will generate a class called Person. You can then use this class in your application to populate, serialize, and retrieve Person protocol buffer messages.

You define gRPC services in ordinary proto files, with RPC method parameters and return types specified as protocol buffer messages:
</p>
<pre lang="jscript">
// The greeter service definition.
service Greeter {
  // Sends a greeting
  rpc SayHello (HelloRequest) returns (HelloReply) {}
}

// The request message containing the user's name.
message HelloRequest {
  string name = 1;
}

// The response message containing the greetings
message HelloReply {
  string message = 1;
}
</pre>
<p>gRPC uses protoc with a special gRPC plugin to generate code from your proto file: you get generated gRPC client and server code, as well as the regular protocol buffer code for populating, serializing, and retrieving your message types. You’ll see an example of this below.</p>
<p>To learn more about protocol buffers, including how to install protoc with the gRPC plugin in your chosen language, see the 
<a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/overview" target="_blank">protocol buffers documentation</a>.

<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2>The Demo</h2>
<p>I have put together a small demo project, which you can use to follow along 
with the steps below</p>
<p><strong>The Contracts</strong></p>
<p>As stateted above you need to start with the Proto file defintion, so for a 
C# project that also means you need the following Nugets</p>
<ul>
	<li>Google.Protobuf : To allow you to create proto files, and have them 
	compiled</li>
	<li>Grpc : To allow you to write gRPC services</li>
	<li>Grpc.Tools : Which allows the auto generation of proxies based on your 
	proto file</li>
</ul>
<p>With these 3 nugets, we can set about creating a small service</p>
<pre lang="jscript">
syntax = "proto3";

option java_multiple_files = true;
option java_package = "io.grpc.examples.demo";
option java_outer_classname = "DemoProto";
option objc_class_prefix = "DMO";

import "google/protobuf/empty.proto";

package demos;

service PubSub {
	rpc GetAnEvent(google.protobuf.Empty) returns (Event) {}
	rpc Subscribe(Subscription) returns (stream Event) {}
	rpc Unsubscribe(Subscription) returns (Unsubscription) {}
}

message Event
{
	string Value = 1;
}
message Subscription
{
	string Id = 1;
}
message Unsubscription
{
	string Id = 1;
}
</pre>
<p>This&nbsp;small proto file contains a service with 3 methods and several data 
types that may be used in the services. The eagle eyed amongst you will see the 
work stream in there as a return type. This is the syntax we use when we want to 
allow server side streaming. We will see how this effects the proxy generation 
later. For now I would urge you all to read this page on gRPC :
<a href="https://grpc.io/docs/what-is-grpc/core-concepts/" target="_blank">
https://grpc.io/docs/what-is-grpc/core-concepts/</a></p>
<h3>What projects does the demo have?</h3>
<p>The demo solution actually contains the following 3 projects</p>
<ul>
	<li>Grpc.Demo : The proto file</li>
	<li>Grpc.Demo.Client : The client code</li>
	<li>Grpc.Demo.Server : The server code</li>
</ul>
<p>We will dive into all of these below</p>
<h3>A request/response</h3>
<p>To do a simple request response is fairly simple, we can just do this in the 
client/server using the automagically generated proxies that the <strong>
Grpc.Tools</strong> compilation does for us</p>
<p><strong>Client code</strong></p>
<pre lang="csharp">
Channel channel = new Channel("127.0.0.1:50051", ChannelCredentials.Insecure);
var client = new PubSub.PubSubClient(channel);
var reply = client.GetAnEvent(new Empty());
Console.WriteLine($"GetAnEvent : {reply}");
</pre>
<p><strong>Server code</strong></p>
<pre lang="csharp">
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Threading;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using System.Threading.Tasks.Dataflow;
using Demos;
using Google.Protobuf.WellKnownTypes;
using Grpc.Core;

namespace Grpc.Demo.Server
{
    public class PubSubImpl : PubSub.PubSubBase
    {
        public override Task&lt;Event&gt; GetAnEvent(Empty request, ServerCallContext context)
        {
            return Task.FromResult(new Event { Value  = DateTime.Now.ToLongTimeString() });
        }
    }
 

    class Program
    {
        const int Port = 50051;

        public static void Main(string[] args)
        {

            //var subManager = new SubscriptionManager();

            var service = new PubSubImpl();
            Core.Server server = new Core.Server
            {
                Services = { Demos.PubSub.BindService(service) },
                Ports = { new ServerPort("localhost", Port, ServerCredentials.Insecure) }
            };
            server.Start();
            Console.ReadKey();
            server.ShutdownAsync().Wait();
        }
    }
}
</pre>
<p>This is fairly simple and easy to understand, the <strong>Grpc.Tools</strong> 
compilation does its job and creates us the proxies/base classes we need, then 
its simply a question of hosting it server side, and calling it from client 
side, simples.</p>
<p>However things start to get a bt interesting when you want to do Duplex 
(server sent messages) back over gRPC. As I said in the introduction there are 
plenty of articles on gPRC, but not that many that fit the bill on duplex stuff. 
The next section will talk about that.</p>
<h3>A duplex request / Server pushed</h3>
<p>Now if you examine the documentation for gRPC where it says this</p>
<p><em>Server streaming RPCs where the client sends a request to the server and gets a stream to read a sequence of messages back. The client reads from the returned stream until there are no more messages. gRPC guarantees message ordering within an individual RPC call.</em></p>
<p>With this proto definition</p>
<pre lang="jscript">
rpc ListFeatures(Rectangle) returns (stream Feature) {}

message Point {
  int32 latitude = 1;
  int32 longitude = 2;
}

message Rectangle {
  Point lo = 1;
  Point hi = 2;
}

message Feature {
  string name = 1;
  Point location = 2;
}

</pre>
<p>You will see this example guidance code</p>
<pre lang="csharp">
public override async Task ListFeatures(Rectangle request, IServerStreamWriter&lt;Feature&gt; responseStream, ServerCallContext context)
        {
            var responses = features.FindAll( (feature) =&gt; feature.Exists() &amp;&amp; request.Contains(feature.Location) );
            foreach (var response in responses)
            {
                await responseStream.WriteAsync(response);
            }
        }
</pre>
<p>Where you can see that we write the <code>responseStream </code>from the context of the 
<code>ListFeatures </code>method. This seems all well and good, but if you have 
ever worked on a serious service where you need to send stuff back from the 
server to the client at some later point, chances are you WILL not be in the 
context of the original calling method. You will in fact be many many 
classes/logic paths away from this original method you called. Even Microsofts 
official Duplex WCF -&gt; gRPC guide make use of this method context to send 
results back to the client</p>
<p>
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/architecture/grpc-for-wcf-developers/migrate-duplex-services">
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/architecture/grpc-for-wcf-developers/migrate-duplex-services</a></p>
<p>Where the Microsoft guidance shows this</p>
<pre lang="csharp">
public override async Task Subscribe(SubscribeRequest request, IServerStreamWriter&lt;StockTickerUpdate&gt; responseStream, ServerCallContext context)
    {
        var subscriber = _subscriberFactory.GetSubscriber(request.Symbols.ToArray());

        subscriber.Update += async (sender, args) =&gt;
            await WriteUpdateAsync(responseStream, args.Symbol, args.Price);

        await AwaitCancellation(context.CancellationToken);
    }
    </pre>
<p>This example makes use of events and the like to do it which to my mind is also a sub-optimal solution. What I want is the ability to just add something to some buffer and then the streaming grpc method would just pick this up and send it back to the client</p>
<p>I have achieved this, and this is how I did it.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1 : The subsciption </strong> </p>
<p>We need a subscription object for the client to send</p>
<pre lang="csharp">
using Demos;

namespace Grpc.Demo.Server
{
    public class SubscriptionEvent
    {
        public Event Event { get; set; }
        public string SubscriptionId { get; set; }
    }
}
</pre>

<p><strong>Step 2 : The client needs to send the subscription and handle the 
subscription callback</strong></p>
<p>For me this meant creating a small class as follows</p>
<pre lang="csharp">
public class Subscriber
{
	private static Demos.PubSub.PubSubClient _pubSubClient;
	private Subscription _subscription;

	public Subscriber(Demos.PubSub.PubSubClient pubSubClient)
	{
		_pubSubClient = pubSubClient;
	}

	public async Task Subscribe(string subscriptionId)
	{
		_subscription = new Subscription() { Id = subscriptionId };
		Console.WriteLine($"&gt;&gt; SubscriptionId : {subscriptionId}");
		using (var call = _pubSubClient.Subscribe(_subscription))
		{
			//Receive
			var responseReaderTask = Task.Run(async () =&gt;
			{
				while (await call.ResponseStream.MoveNext())
				{
					Console.WriteLine("Event received: " + call.ResponseStream.Current);
				}
			});

			await responseReaderTask;
		}
	}

	public void Unsubscribe()
	{
		_pubSubClient.Unsubscribe(_subscription);
	}
}
</pre>
<p>Which I could then use in the client code as follows</p>
<pre lang="csharp">
class Program
{
	public static void Main(string[] args)
	{
		Channel channel = new Channel("127.0.0.1:50051", ChannelCredentials.Insecure);
		var client = new PubSub.PubSubClient(channel);
		var subscriber = new Subscriber(client);

		Task.Run(async () =&gt;
		{
			await subscriber.Subscribe(Guid.NewGuid().ToString("N"));
		}).ConfigureAwait(false).GetAwaiter();
		

		Console.WriteLine("Hit key to unsubscribe");
		Console.ReadLine();

		subscriber.Unsubscribe();

		Console.WriteLine("Unsubscribed...");

		Console.WriteLine("Hit key to exit...");
		Console.ReadLine();
	}

}
</pre>
<p>So that is all for the client side, so now on to the server side</p>

<p><strong>Step 3 : The server side </strong> </p>
<p>So now we have a subscription from the client how should the server deal with 
it. Remember for me what I wanted was the ability to push data into some buffer 
and have that data sent back to the client. I wanted to able to do this from 
anywhere and any thread. </p>
<p>So how can one achieve this? Well we can make use of the DataFlow API 
specifically the <code>BufferBlock&lt;T&gt;</code> class, which provides a buffer for 
storing data for a Dataflow. By using this class, we are able to spawn a thread 
to send data to the client. The thread is really just to show that we can force 
the sending of data from the server to the client outside the scope of the 
original gRPC call and in a new thread of your choice.</p>
<p>OK so that is how I do it here is the relevant server side code</p>
<pre lang="csharp">
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Threading;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using System.Threading.Tasks.Dataflow;
using Demos;
using Google.Protobuf.WellKnownTypes;
using Grpc.Core;

namespace Grpc.Demo.Server
{
    public class PubSubImpl : PubSub.PubSubBase
    {
        private readonly BufferBlock&lt;SubscriptionEvent&gt; _buffer = new BufferBlock&lt;SubscriptionEvent&gt;();

        public PubSubImpl()
        {
            SubscriberWritersMap = new Dictionary&lt;string, IServerStreamWriter&lt;Event&gt;&gt;();
        }

        public override async Task Subscribe(Subscription subscription, IServerStreamWriter&lt;Event&gt; responseStream, ServerCallContext context)
        {
            //Dict to hold a streamWriter for each subscriber.
            SubscriberWritersMap[subscription.Id] = responseStream;

            while (SubscriberWritersMap.Count &gt; 0)
            {
                //Wait on BufferBlock from MS Dataflow package.
                var subscriptionEvent = await _buffer.ReceiveAsync();
                if (SubscriberWritersMap.ContainsKey(subscriptionEvent.SubscriptionId))
                {
                    await SubscriberWritersMap[subscriptionEvent.SubscriptionId].WriteAsync(subscriptionEvent.Event);
                }

            }
        }

        public override Task&lt;Unsubscription&gt; Unsubscribe(Subscription request, ServerCallContext context)
        {
            SubscriberWritersMap.Remove(request.Id);
            return Task.FromResult(new Unsubscription() { Id = request.Id });
        }

        public void Publish(SubscriptionEvent subscriptionEvent)
        {
            _buffer.Post(subscriptionEvent);
        }

        public Dictionary&lt;string, IServerStreamWriter&lt;Event&gt;&gt; SubscriberWritersMap { get; private set; }

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>gRPC is cool for sure, and fact you can use many languages is also great, and 
I hope this small aticle has shown you how you can wrestle back a bit of control 
over just how your duplex gRPC services can work more like traditonal pub/sub 
type of RPC (such as WCF)</p>
